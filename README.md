# comp1073-assignment1
The purpose of this assignment is to use JS to create a website that emulates the experience of the book Mattel® ‘See ‘N’ Say Storymaker’. You can watch a short video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsQVG3S5-9U&ab_channel=SoundBit) that shows how that book works. Basically, the book has five buttons and each one has seven words in it. The first button is filled with nouns, the second with verbs, the third with adjectives, the fourth with another set of nouns and the final one with a location. The user presses each button to select one of the words in it, and in the end the user presses a final button that displays the whole sentence made.
